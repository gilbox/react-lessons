# Exploring this Repo

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- Then either `gulp watch`
- Or `gulp watch01`, or `gulp watch02`, etc...
- Navigate to [http://localhost:4444/public](http://localhost:4444/public)

# Messing around

If `gulp watch` is running, you can open [http://localhost:4444/public](http://localhost:4444/public) and then edit any `app.js` file and the web page will auto-reload whenever you click *save* (so long as syntax errors don't cause compilation to fail).
